Overview

The Mini Game Store Project is a Java-based application that demonstrates the use of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in creating a simple game store. 

This project includes three classic games: Guess the Number, Hangman, and Tic Tac Toe. The project uses fundamental data structures such as Arrays, Binary Search, and Linked Lists to manage game data and user interactions efficiently.
